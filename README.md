# uberscan2
The all-new Python version of Uberscan!

It seems the original Uberscan, which I put a LOT of work into, doesn't work anymore. (your mileage may vary)
So I'm gonna have to port the sucker to Python...

So far I've got some SMTP and Telnet compatibility. Give it a go, let me know what you think.
